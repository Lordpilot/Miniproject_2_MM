```{r, include=FALSE}

```

We have the dataset ChestSim1000
```{r}
data(chestSim1000, package="gRbase")
head(chestSim1000)
```

This is a hyphotetical Chest Clinic problem, by Lauritzen and Spiegelhalter. (ref til https://arxiv.org/pdf/1301.7394.pdf)

Here is a short explanation of the variables in the dataset.

* asia $\rightarrow$ subject has visited asia
* tub $\rightarrow$ subject has tuberculosis
* smoke $\rightarrow$ subject is a smoker
* lung $\rightarrow$ subject has lung cancer
* bronc $\rightarrow$ subject has bronchitis
* either $\rightarrow$ subject has either tuberculosis or lungcancer
* xray $\rightarrow$ subject has positive X-ray
* dysp $\rightarrow$ Subject has dyspnoea

Shortness-of-breath (dyspnoea) may be due to tuberculosis, lung cancer, bronchitis, none of them, or more than one of them. A recent visit to Asia increases the chances of tuberculosis, while smoking is known to be a risk factor for both lung cancer and bronchitis. The results of a single chest X-ray do not discriminate between lung cancer and tuberculosis, as does neither the presence nor absence of dyspnoea.
